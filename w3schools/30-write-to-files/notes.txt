fopen(filename, mode):
- w (Writes to a file)
- a (Appends new data to a file)
- r (Reads from a file)

Tip:
- If you want to create the file in a specific folder, 
- just provide an absolute path:
- fptr = fopen("C:\directoryname\filename.txt", "w");

using w mode: 
- If you write to a file that already exists, 
- the old content is deleted, and the new content is inserted. 
- This is important to know, as you might accidentally erase existing content.

using a mode:
- If you want to add content to a file without deleting the old content, you can use the a mode.
- The a mode appends content at the end of the file.
- Just like with the w mode; if the file does not exist, the a mode will create a new file with the "appended" content.
