If you use scanf() and NOT strings:
- You have to use the reference operator (&).
- You don't have to specify the size of the string/array
- For example: char myChar; scanf("%c", &myNum);

If you use scanf() and strings:
- You don't have to use the reference operator (&).
- You must specify the size of the string/array
- For example: char firstName[30]; scanf("%s", firstName);

scanf():
- It considers space (whitespace, tabs, etc) as a terminating character
- which means that it can only display a single word

fgets():
- A function to read a line of text.
- You must include the following arguments: 
- the name of the string variable, sizeof(string_name), and stdin
